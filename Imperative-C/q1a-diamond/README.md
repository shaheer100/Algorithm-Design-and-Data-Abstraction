[q1a-diamond] In this question you will write a program that recursively reads integers from the keyboard and draws diamonds. We've included a function that reads input.
Write a function draw_diamond, which takes a positive odd integer as a parameter and will draw a diamond of the specified size, where size specifies the maximum number of o characters printed across a single line. The minimum size of a valid diamond is 1.
For example, if the input is:

5 9
The expected output for draw_diamond would be:

   *
  /o\
 /ooo\
/ooooo\
\ooooo/
 \ooo/
  \o/
   *
     *
    /o\
   /ooo\
  /ooooo\
 /ooooooo\
/ooooooooo\
\ooooooooo/
 \ooooooo/
  \ooooo/
   \ooo/
    \o/
     *
