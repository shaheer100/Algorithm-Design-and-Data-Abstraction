[q1cd-hexagonal] The following two question parts deal with hexagonal numbers. If you create outlines of regular hexagons with sides up to n dots, the nth hexagonal number is the number of distinct dots when the hexagons are overlaid so that they share one vertex. The formula for the nth hexagonal number is: 2n^2-n . See the link for more details.
Implement the function is_hexagonal(n). The function determines whether a number is hexagonal. To make sure that your implementation is correct, write your own assertion-based tests.

For example, is_hexagonal(6) will return true.

Implement the function nth_hexagonal(n). The function calculates the nth hexagonal number. To make sure that your implementation is correct, write your own assertion-based tests.

For example, nth_hexagonal(3) will return 15.
