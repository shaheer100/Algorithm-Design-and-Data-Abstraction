[q1b-sum_digits] Implement the functions sum_digits_simple(n) and sum_digits_acc(n). Both functions calculate the sum of the digits in n recursively, the first using simple recursion, the last using accumulative recursion. See the documentation of sum_digits_simple and sum_digits_acc in main.c for more information. To make sure that your implementation is correct, write your own assertion-based tests.
